                </h2>
                <p> 
                    Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 – April 5, 1994) 
                    was an American singer-songwriter and musician, best 
                    known as the guitarist, primary songwriter and frontman 
                    of the rock band Nirvana. Through his angst-fueled 
                    songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's 
                    compositions widened the thematic conventions of 
                    mainstream rock music. He was often heralded as a 
                    spokesman of Generation X and is considered to be one of 
                    the most influential musicians in the history of 
                    alternative rock.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Born in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain formed the band 
                    Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 
                    1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music 
                    scene which later became known as grunge. After 
                    signing with major label DGC Records, Nirvana found 
                    global success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from 
                    their critically acclaimed second album Nevermind (1991). Although Cobain was hailed as the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success, he resented this, believing his message and artistic vision had been misinterpreted by the public. In addition to "Smells Like Teen Spirit", Cobain wrote many notable songs for Nirvana including "About a Girl", "In Bloom", "Come as You Are", "Lithium", "Polly", "Something in the Way", "All Apologies" and "Heart-Shaped Box".

                    Early Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cobain was born at Grays Harbor Hospital in Aberdeen, 
                    Washington on February 20, 1967,[3] the son of waitress 
                    Wendy Elizabeth (née Fradenburg; born 1948)[4] and 
                    automotive mechanic Donald Leland Cobain (born 1946). 
                    His parents were married on July 31, 1965, in Coeur 
                    d'Alene, Idaho. His ancestry included Dutch, English, 
                    French, German, Irish, and Scottish.[5]:13[6][7]:7 His 
                    Irish ancestors emigrated from Carrickmore, County 
                    Tyrone in 1875.[7]:7 Researchers found that they were 
                    shoemakers, originally named "Cobane", who came from 
                    Inishatieve, a townland within Carrickmore. They first 
                    settled in Cornwall, Ontario, Canada, and then in 
                    Washington.[8] Cobain himself believed his family came 
                    from County Cork.[9] His younger sister, Kimberly, was 
                    born on April 24, 1970.

                <p>
                    After months of asking, Novoselic finally agreed to 
                    join Cobain, forming the beginnings of Nirvana.[5]:45 
                    Religion appeared to remain a significant muse to 
                    Cobain during this time, as he often used Christian 
                    related imagery in his work, and developed a budding 
                    interest in Jainism and Buddhist philosophy. The band 
                    name "Nirvana" was taken from the Buddhist concept, 
                    which Cobain described as "freedom from pain, suffering 
                    and the external world," a concept that he aligned with 
                    the punk rock ethos and ideology.

                    Musical influences
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Beatles were an early and lasting influence on 
                    Cobain; his aunt Mari remembers him singing "Hey Jude" 
                    at the age of two.[7]:9 "My aunts would give me Beatles 
                    records," Cobain told Jon Savage in 1993, "so for the 
                    most part [I listened to] the Beatles [as a child], 
                    and if I was lucky, I'd be able to buy a single."[13] 
                    Cobain expressed a particular fondness for John Lennon, 
                    whom he called his "idol" in his posthumously released 
                    journals,[14] and he admitted that he wrote the song 
                    "About a Girl", from Nirvana's 1989 debut album Bleach,
                     after spending three hours listening to Meet the 
                     Beatles!.
